# OVAL Schemas

OVAL Schemas are made by [OVAL Community](https://github.com/OVAL-Community/OVAL). Schemas are serving as the framework and vocabulary of the OVAL Language. You may use schemas to validate any OVAL content: definitions, system characteristics and oval results. With this tool there are several versions supplied:
- 5.10.1 is a last supported version of OVALdi;
- 5.11.1 is a last supported version of OpenSCAP;
- 5.11.2 is a last version of OVAL schema with IOS-XE support.
